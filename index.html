    <h1> I am sick of this!</h1>
    <p>At OZSM (Ozair and Simran), we're a pioneering startup dedicated to redefining accessibility across Australia, operating on the core belief that technology 
        should empower, not hinder, people with disabilities. Our team of innovators and advocates came together to bridge the gap between modern technology and real-world challenges,
         creating holistic, human-centered solutions that break down physical, digital, and social barriers. Driven by a passion for empowerment, a commitment to inclusion, and a spirit of 
         collaboration, we craft everything from AI-driven wayfinding apps to universally designed digital platforms. We are more than a company; we are a movement dedicated to ensuring that
          every journey, physical or digital, is one of freedom and dignity..</p>
